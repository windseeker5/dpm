I want you to implement this plan that we have here : 

I want you to act as an orchestrator and delegate the task to 
the most qualified agent

Always create unit tests to test your job and save those tests in my /test folder.
Always use MCP playwright server to do your test and save screenshot in /test/playwright/ 
Always use the up and running flask server on port 5000 ( user = kdresdell@gmail.com  password = admin123 )
Alway choose python and flask over JavaScript "
Alwas keep the Jaavscript to the mininum and less than 50 line of code when it is 
possible.If you write more than 50 lines, STOP and tell me you're overcomplicating it.

DO NOT:
 - Do not add ANY global event listeners
 - Do not Touch ANY search functionality
 - Do not Touch ANY filter functionality  
 - Do not Use WeakMap, RequestQueue, or any complex patterns
 - Do not Add "monitoring", "performance", or "enterprise" features
 - Do not Write more than 50 lines javascript
