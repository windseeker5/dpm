# Project Cleanup Summary

## Date: 2025-08-21

### What Was Done

Successfully reorganized the project structure to eliminate clutter and establish clear file organization rules.

### Files Moved

#### 1. Test Files (50+ files) → `/test/`
- All `test_*.py` files
- Debug and verification scripts
- Utility test scripts
- HTML test files → `/test/html/`

#### 2. Documentation (20+ files) → `/doc/`
- Implementation documentation (`*_IMPLEMENTATION.md`)
- Summary documentation (`*_SUMMARY.md`)
- Architecture documentation
- Manual test instructions
- All documentation except CLAUDE.md and README.md (which remain in root)

#### 3. Screenshots (30+ files) → `/playwright/`
- All `.png` screenshot files
- Test result images
- UI verification screenshots

### Directory Structure Created

```
/app/
├── /doc/          # All documentation files
├── /test/         # All test files
│   ├── /html/     # HTML test files
│   ├── /debug/    # Debug scripts
│   └── /scripts/  # Utility scripts
└── /playwright/   # All screenshots
```

### CLAUDE.md Updated

Added strict file organization rules that enforce:
- No test files in root directory
- No documentation in root (except CLAUDE.md and README.md)
- No screenshots outside of /playwright/
- Clear categorization for all file types

### Results

- **Before**: 60+ files scattered in root directory
- **After**: Clean root with only essential files (app.py, models.py, config.py, etc.)
- **Organization**: All files now properly categorized in designated folders
- **Maintainability**: Much easier to navigate and find files

### Benefits

1. **Cleaner workspace**: Root directory only contains core application files
2. **Better organization**: Clear separation of concerns
3. **Easier navigation**: Know exactly where to find each type of file
4. **Enforced standards**: CLAUDE.md now enforces these rules for future work
5. **No broken imports**: All Python imports still work correctly
