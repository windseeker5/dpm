# Activity Card Placeholder Fix - Implementation Summary

## ✅ Problem Solved

The activity cards on the dashboard page were displaying incorrectly when activities didn't have cover images. The blue calendar icon in the placeholder was not properly centered in the blue gradient background, and cards appeared too tall.

## 🔧 Root Cause

The issue was with how the placeholder image was implemented:

### Before (Broken):
```html
<div class="img-responsive img-responsive-21x9 card-img-top" 
     style="background: linear-gradient(45deg, #e3f2fd 0%, #2196f3 100%); display: flex; align-items: center; justify-content: center;">
  <i class="ti ti-calendar-event" style="font-size: 3rem; color: #1976d2; opacity: 0.8;"></i>
</div>
```

**Problem**: The `.img-responsive-21x9` class uses `padding-top: 42.8571428571%` to maintain a 21:9 aspect ratio, but applying `display: flex` directly on this container interfered with the aspect ratio mechanism.

### After (Fixed):
```html
<div class="img-responsive img-responsive-21x9 card-img-top" 
     style="background: linear-gradient(45deg, #e3f2fd 0%, #2196f3 100%); position: relative;">
  <div style="position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; right: 0; bottom: 0; display: flex; align-items: center; justify-content: center;">
    <i class="ti ti-calendar-event" style="font-size: 3rem; color: #1976d2; opacity: 0.8;"></i>
  </div>
</div>
```

**Solution**: Separate the aspect-ratio container from the centering mechanism using absolute positioning.
