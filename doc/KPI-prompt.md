  PROMPT TO USE AFTER REVERTING:

  TASK: Fix KPI card value updates ONLY.

  CURRENT SITUATION:
  - I have 8 KPI cards total (4 on dashboard.html, 4 on activity_dashboard.html)
  - The cards display but values might be wrong or not updating
  - Everything else works perfectly (Ctrl+K search, filter buttons, etc.)

  REQUIREMENTS:
  1. DELETE the file /static/js/kpi-card-manager.js completely
  2. REMOVE all references to kpi-card-manager.js from dashboard.html and activity_dashboard.html
  3. Create a SINGLE function directly in activity_dashboard.html to update KPI values
  4. Maximum 50 lines of code total
  5. Use namespace: window.SimpleKPI = { updateCard: function() {...} }

  CONSTRAINTS - DO NOT:
  - Create ANY new files
  - Add ANY global event listeners
  - Touch ANY search functionality
  - Touch ANY filter functionality  
  - Use WeakMap, RequestQueue, or any complex patterns
  - Add "monitoring", "performance", or "enterprise" features
  - Write more than 50 lines

  ONLY FIX:
  The KPI card values should update when clicking their period dropdowns (7d, 30d, 90d).

  TEST BEFORE MARKING COMPLETE:
  □ Ctrl+K search still works with sound
  □ Filter buttons still work
  □ KPI values update correctly

  If you write more than 50 lines, STOP and tell me you're overcomplicating it.

  Why This Prompt Works:

  1. Specific Constraints: No new files, max 50 lines
  2. Clear Scope: ONLY fix KPI values
  3. Delete First: Removes the bad code before adding anything
  4. Namespace Required: Prevents global pollution
  5. Test Checklist: Ensures nothing else breaks
  6. Self-Check: "If more than 50 lines, STOP"

  Alternative Even Simpler Prompt:

  The KPI cards don't update values when clicking 7d/30d/90d.
  Fix this bug in maximum 30 lines of inline JavaScript.
  Do NOT create new files or break anything else.
  Test that Ctrl+K and filters still work.

  What NOT to Say:

  ❌ "Rebuild the KPI system"
  ❌ "Make it better"
  ❌ "Create a proper architecture"
  ❌ "Fix all KPI issues"

  Use the first prompt - it's very constrained and will prevent me from going crazy with overengineering again.
