# Visual Logo Concepts - minipass Activities Management Platform

## Brand Repositioning Overview

minipass has evolved from a Digital Passport Management system to a comprehensive **Activities Management Platform**. The visual identity must reflect this transformation while maintaining our professional SaaS aesthetic and shield-based security symbolism.
