I need you to think harder about this new feature I want to implement.

Please help me plan a new module for my Minipass app. I want you to write the plan in aibotplan.md.

The goal is to implement a simple and intuitive AI and LLM analytic chat bot within the app.

Hereâ€™s what I have in mind :

- a new template page should be created call "Analityc AI bot"

- The goal here is to have the user chat with an ai agent about all his data stored in his database. As an example, a user could as the simple questions like this :
   Give me the list of user that did not paid for activity golf 2025 ?

   Give me the list of regular user for ligue de hockey gagnon image ?


- the template look and feel should be user friendly , fun to use have a great ui ux , like any popular chat messaging tools.


- Right now , i do no have any idea on what ai llm provider to use, so please help me white that be telling me waht are my option and the provider pricing. My App will be host on hetzner VPS in a docker container.

For the prototype phase, i can use a ollama server that i have at home and it can be acces to a public address IP

Can you help me plan and design this new feature?
