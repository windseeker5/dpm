I need you to think harder about this new feature I want to implement.

Please help me plan a new module for my Minipass app. I want you to write the plan in Chatbotplan.md.

The goal is to implement a simple and intuitive AI and LLM analytic chatbot within the app.

Hereâ€™s what I have in mind:

    A new template page should be created called "Analytics Chatbot".

    The goal here is to have the user chat with an AI agent about all their data stored in their database. As an example, a user could ask simple questions like this:
    Give me the list of users that did not pay for activity Golf 2025?
    Give me the list of regular users for Ligue de Hockey Gagnon Image?

    The template look and feel should be user-friendly, fun to use, and have a great UI/UX, like any popular chat messaging tool.

    Right now, I do not have any idea which AI LLM provider to use, so please help me with that by telling me what are my options and the provider pricing. My app will be hosted on Hetzner VPS using a Docker container per organization.

For the prototype phase, I can use an Ollama server that I have at home, and it can be accessed via a public IP address.

Can you help me plan and design this new feature?
