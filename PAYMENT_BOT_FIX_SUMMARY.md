# Payment Bot Bug - Investigation Summary

## Problem Confirmed

**User was RIGHT**: The bot WAS running in October, NOT stopped for 35 days. The bot successfully marked passports as paid, but had a bug preventing proper audit trail.

## Evidence

### Database Analysis
- **74 paid passports total**
- **42 have `marked_paid_by` set** (all marked by "jf@jfgoulet.com" - manual admin action)
- **32 have `marked_paid_by = NULL`** (43.2%) - these were marked by buggy bot
- **ZERO passports have `marked_paid_by = "gmail-bot@system"`** - confirms bot field not persisting

### Specific Cases (Oct 27, 2025)
1. **Jean B√©langer** - Passport #90
   - Paid date: 2025-10-27 18:23:07
   - marked_paid_by: NULL
   - Bot found it already paid on Nov 1, created NO_MATCH

2. **Samuel Turbide** - Passport #78
   - Paid date: 2025-10-27 12:23:07
   - marked_paid_by: NULL
   - Bot found it already paid on Nov 1, created NO_MATCH

3. **Patrick Beland** - No matching passport found (different issue)

## Root Cause

**The bot in October was PARTIALLY working:**
1. ‚úÖ Found payment emails
2. ‚úÖ Matched to correct passports
3. ‚úÖ Set `passport.paid = True`
4. ‚úÖ Set `passport.paid_date = timestamp`
5. ‚ùå Set `passport.marked_paid_by = "gmail-bot@system"` BUT IT DIDN'T PERSIST
6. ‚ùå Created `EbankPayment` MATCHED record BUT IT FAILED (no records created)
7. ‚ùå Moved emails to processed folder BUT IT FAILED (emails stayed in inbox)

**Why marked_paid_by didn't persist**: UNKNOWN - needs live testing with new logging

**Why emails weren't moved**: Likely IMAP failure, but not critical since it's after DB commit

## Fixes Implemented

### 1. Comprehensive Logging ‚úÖ
Added detailed pre/post-commit logging to `utils.py`:
- Shows exact state before commit
- Flushes session explicitly
- Refreshes object after commit
- Detects if `marked_paid_by` didn't persist
- Shows "‚ùå BUG DETECTED" if field is NULL after commit

### 2. Exception Handling ‚úÖ
Wrapped payment processing in try/except:
- Catches any exceptions during processing
- Rolls back transaction on failure
- Continues to next payment instead of crashing
- Prints full stack trace for debugging

### 3. Display Bug Fixed ‚úÖ
Fixed `get_pass_history_data()` in `utils.py`:
- Now shows actual `marked_paid_by` value from database
- Falls back to session admin only if field is NULL
- Shows "system (no audit trail)" if no data available
- No longer misleads user by showing their email for bot-marked passports

### 4. Database Schema Checked ‚úÖ
- Foreign key constraint exists but is NOT enforced (SQLite pragma = 0)
- `EbankPayment.matched_pass_id` references old "pass" table, not "passport" table
- Not causing failures, but is a data integrity issue

## Testing Scripts Created

### 1. `test_payment_bot.py`
Manually trigger payment bot with detailed logging output

### 2. `diagnose_payment_records.py`
Analyze current state of payment records, identify issues

## Next Steps

### Immediate (User to do)

1. **Run bot manually** to see if the bug still occurs:
   ```bash
   cd /home/kdresdell/Documents/DEV/minipass_env/app
   venv/bin/python test_payment_bot.py
   ```

2. **Watch for these log messages**:
   - `üéØ MATCH FOUND` - bot found a match
   - `üîç PRE-COMMIT STATE` - shows marked_paid_by = 'gmail-bot@system'
   - `‚úÖ COMMITTED to database` - transaction completed
   - `üîç POST-COMMIT VERIFICATION` - shows what actually persisted
   - `‚ùå BUG DETECTED: marked_paid_by didn't persist!` - THE SMOKING GUN

3. **If bug is detected**: We'll know exactly where the field is being lost

4. **If bug is NOT detected**: The fixes we made (explicit flush, better session handling) may have resolved it

### Follow-up Fixes (if needed)

**If marked_paid_by still doesn't persist:**
- Check for SQLAlchemy session auto-flush settings
- Add database-level trigger to log changes
- Consider using raw SQL UPDATE to bypass ORM
- Check if there's a model __setattr__ override interfering

**Additional improvements:**
- Move email BEFORE committing (transaction safety)
- Fix foreign key reference (pass ‚Üí passport)
- Add retry logic for IMAP failures
- Create cleanup script to backfill missing marked_paid_by values

## Files Modified

1. `/home/kdresdell/Documents/DEV/minipass_env/app/utils.py`
   - Lines 1514-1603: Added logging, exception handling, explicit flush
   - Lines 617-628: Fixed display bug in get_pass_history_data()

2. `/home/kdresdell/Documents/DEV/minipass_env/app/test_payment_bot.py` (NEW)
   - Manual test script

3. `/home/kdresdell/Documents/DEV/minipass_env/app/diagnose_payment_records.py` (NEW)
   - Diagnostic analysis script

## Success Criteria

‚úÖ Confirmed bot was running (not stopped for 35 days)
‚úÖ Identified exact fields that aren't persisting
‚úÖ Added comprehensive debugging
‚úÖ Fixed misleading display
‚úÖ Ready for live testing to identify persistence bug

‚ùì **NEXT**: Run test_payment_bot.py and watch logs for "BUG DETECTED" message
