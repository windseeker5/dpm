Create a minimalist text-only logo for "minipass" - a SaaS platform for digital passes and QR codes.

STYLE REFERENCE: Stripe (note the geometric cut in the "S"), Linear, GitHub - clean wordmarks with subtle distinctive features

BRAND NAME: "minipass" (all lowercase, one word)

TYPOGRAPHY REQUIREMENTS:
- Modern geometric sans-serif font (similar to Inter, DM Sans, or Manrope)
- All lowercase: "minipass"
- Professional tech startup aesthetic
- Black text (#000000) on pure white background (#FFFFFF)
- Perfect letter spacing and kerning

SPECIAL "M" STYLING (Key Feature):
- The letter "m" should have a distinctive geometric treatment
- Inspired by QR code patterns: small geometric squares or pixel-like details integrated into the "m"
- Could be: geometric cuts, modular grid pattern, or subtle QR-code-inspired squares within the letter structure
- Keep it subtle and elegant - not overwhelming
- The "m" should still be readable but visually distinctive
- Think: Stripe's triangular "S" cut, but with a QR/digital pass theme for the "m"

STYLE:
- Clean, sharp, high contrast
- Slightly wide letter spacing for modern tech feel
- The special "m" should be the focal point but remain sophisticated

STRICT RULES:
- NO separate icons or graphics outside the text
- NO gradients or drop shadows
- NO taglines
- ONLY the word "minipass" with special "m" treatment

OUTPUT:
- High resolution (at least 2000px width)
- Centered on white background
- The "m" styling should be geometric and precise, not hand-drawn

Think: "Stripe's logo sophistication + QR code geometry for a digital pass platform" 

SPECIFIC STYLING FOR THIS VARIATION:
- The "m" is constructed from a subtle modular grid
- Reminiscent of QR code pixel structure
- Still flows as a letter but has visible geometric construction
- Very minimal - just enough to suggest digital/technical
