Create a minimalist text-only logo for "minipass" - a SaaS platform for digital passes and QR codes.

STYLE REFERENCE: Stripe (note the geometric cut in the "S"), Linear, GitHub - clean wordmarks with subtle distinctive features

BRAND NAME: "minipass" (all lowercase, one word)

TYPOGRAPHY REQUIREMENTS:
- Modern geometric sans-serif font (similar to Inter, DM Sans, or Manrope)
- All lowercase: "minipass"
- Professional tech startup aesthetic
- Black text (#000000) on pure white background (#FFFFFF)
- Perfect letter spacing and kerning

SPECIAL "M" STYLING (Key Feature - DYNAMIC EFFECT):
- The letter "m" should have a distinctive geometric treatment with MOTION
- Inspired by QR code patterns: geometric squares of VARYING SIZES that appear to be "detaching" or "flowing" from the letter
- DYNAMIC CONCEPT: A MINIMAL number of QR-code-inspired squares/pixels (approximately 8-15 total) should appear to be breaking away from the "m" and flowing downward/trailing behind, creating a sense of speed and digital transformation
- CRITICAL FOR SCALABILITY: Use squares of different sizes - mix larger squares (more prominent) with a few medium and small ones
- NO tiny or intricate details that will disappear at small logo sizes (must be visible when logo is 100px wide)
- The effect should look like digital particles or pixels dispersing from the letter, suggesting movement and data flow
- The squares should be bold and clean, not clustered or complex - think "less is more"
- Keep the "m" itself still readable and solid, with the dynamic effect concentrated at the edges (especially top-left or top-right areas)
- Think: Digital disintegration effect, like QR code data streaming or particles in motion - but SIMPLIFIED for web use
- The flowing pixels should maintain the geometric precision of QR codes but suggest kinetic energy
- Overall vibe: "Data in motion" or "Digital transformation happening" - achieved with minimal, bold geometric elements

STYLE:
- Clean, sharp, high contrast
- Slightly wide letter spacing for modern tech feel
- The special "m" should be the focal point but remain sophisticated

STRICT RULES:
- NO separate icons or graphics outside the text
- NO gradients or drop shadows
- NO taglines
- ONLY the word "minipass" with special "m" treatment

OUTPUT:
- High resolution (at least 2000px width)
- Centered on white background
- The "m" styling should be geometric and precise, not hand-drawn

Think: "Stripe's logo sophistication + QR code geometry for a digital pass platform"
