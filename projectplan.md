# Activity Form Refactoring Project Plan

## Problem Analysis
The current `activity_form.html` is complex with multiple card sections and JavaScript functionality that makes it difficult to use. The backup file `activity_form_bk_ken.html` appears to be a cleaner, more streamlined version that should replace the current form.

## Objectives
- Restore the simplified form from the backup
- Create a good-looking, user-friendly activity creation form
- Maintain all essential functionality while removing complexity
- Ensure the form follows modern UI/UX principles

## Current State Analysis

### Current Form (`activity_form.html`) Issues:
- Multiple card sections make it overwhelming (Definition, Image Selection, Pricing, Goals, Financial Performance)
- Complex JavaScript for image handling with Unsplash integration
- Too many fields presented at once
- Visual clutter with emojis in section headers

### Backup Form (`activity_form_bk_ken.html`) Advantages:
- Single card layout is cleaner
- Simplified structure with logical field grouping
- Better responsive design with proper Bootstrap classes
- More intuitive image selection workflow
- Cleaner JavaScript with modal-based image selection
