Help me to plan and reorganize my 'create activity' and 'edit activity' page. in order to be more intuitive and friendly for users.


This image showing the actual organisation.....


First, I want to simplify, minimize and regroup existing elements displayed on that form

The fist section should be titled "Activity definition" and regroup those elements :

- Activity Name
- Activity Type ( Recurent or one time )    - Status
- Description 
- Start Date    -  End Date
- Activity Image


The second section should be titled "Passport type". This section should regroup :

- An Overview of already created passport type with an edit button to expand the form
- the Signup Links dedicated to the passport type
- regular size button to create a new passport type


The third section should be titled "Financial ledger". this section should regroup :

- detailled financial reports per month and Quarter for that activity
- + Add income button that will pop a modal or expanse our add income form
- + Add expense button that will pop a modal or expanse our add expense form

What are the best pracices in ui, ux developement for that kind of page, should we put each section in Accordion ? what will be the best design for the user ?
