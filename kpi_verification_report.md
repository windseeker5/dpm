# KPI API Data Structure and Backend Verification Report

## Issue Analysis

The frontend KPI indicators were showing "0% —" instead of actual percentage changes with trend arrows.

## Root Cause Identified

The problem was in the `get_kpi_data()` function in `/home/kdresdell/Documents/DEV/minipass_env/app/utils.py`. When calculating percentage changes:

```python
# OLD PROBLEMATIC CODE:
revenue_change = ((current_revenue - prev_revenue) / prev_revenue * 100) if prev_revenue > 0 else 0
```

**Issue**: When `prev_revenue = 0` (no data in previous period) but `current_revenue > 0` (data in current period), the change defaulted to `0` instead of showing growth.

## Data Context

Based on database analysis:
- **Current data (Aug 31, 2025)**:
  - Aug 30: 5 passports, $550 revenue
  - Aug 24: 14 passports, $638 revenue  
  - Aug 31: $500 income
  
- **7d period**: Aug 24-31 (current) vs Aug 17-24 (previous)
  - Current period: $1,688 total revenue
  - Previous period: $0 (no data)
  - Result with old logic: 0% change
  - Result with new logic: 100% change ✅

## Fixes Applied

### 1. Revenue Change Calculation
```python
# FIXED CODE in utils.py lines ~473-478:
if prev_revenue > 0:
    revenue_change = ((current_revenue - prev_revenue) / prev_revenue * 100)
elif current_revenue > 0:
    revenue_change = 100.0  # New revenue, show as 100% increase
else:
    revenue_change = 0
```

### 2. Passports Created Change Calculation
```python
# FIXED CODE in utils.py lines ~509-514:
if prev_passports_created > 0:
    passports_created_change = ((current_passports_created - prev_passports_created) / prev_passports_created * 100)
elif current_passports_created > 0:
    passports_created_change = 100.0  # New passports, show as 100% increase
else:
    passports_created_change = 0
```

### 3. Unpaid Passports Change Calculation
```python
# FIXED CODE in utils.py lines ~539-544:
if prev_unpaid > 0:
    unpaid_change = ((current_period_unpaid - prev_unpaid) / prev_unpaid * 100)
elif current_period_unpaid > 0:
    unpaid_change = 100.0  # New unpaid passports, show as 100% increase
else:
    unpaid_change = 0
```

## API Endpoint Verification

**Endpoint**: `GET /api/kpi-data?period={7d|30d|90d|all}`

**Expected Response Structure** (now with proper change values):
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "period": "7d", 
  "activity_id": null,
  "kpi_data": {
    "revenue": {
      "current": 1688.0,
      "previous": 0,
      "change": 100.0,  // ✅ FIXED: Now shows 100% instead of 0%
      "trend": [638.0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 550.0, 500.0]
    },
    "active_users": {
      "current": 24,
      "previous": null,
      "change": null,
      "trend": [14, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0]
    },
    "passports_created": {
      "current": 19,
      "previous": 0,
      "change": 100.0,  // ✅ FIXED: Now shows 100% instead of 0%
      "trend": [14, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0]
    },
    "passports_unpaid": {
      "current": 9,
      "previous": 0,
      "change": 100.0,  // ✅ FIXED: Now shows 100% instead of 0%
      "trend": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
    }
  }
}
```

## Template Compatibility

The dashboard template at `/home/kdresdell/Documents/DEV/minipass_env/app/templates/dashboard.html` is correctly structured:

```html
{% set change = kpi_data.revenue.change %}
{% if change is not none %}
  {% if change > 0 %}
    <div class="text-success me-2" id="revenue-trend">{{ change|round|int }}% <i class="ti ti-trending-up"></i></div>
  {% elif change < 0 %}
    <div class="text-danger me-2" id="revenue-trend">{{ change|abs|round|int }}% <i class="ti ti-trending-down"></i></div>
  {% else %}
    <div class="text-muted me-2" id="revenue-trend">0% <i class="ti ti-minus"></i></div>
  {% endif %}
{% endif %}
```

## Security & Performance

✅ **API Security**: 
- `@admin_required` decorator
- `@rate_limit(max_requests=30, window=60)` 
- `@log_api_call` for audit trails
- Input validation for periods and activity_ids

✅ **Performance**:
- `@cache_response(timeout=60)` for caching
- Optimized database queries with grouping
- Single queries instead of per-day iterations

## Expected Results

After the fix, users should see:

1. **Revenue KPI**: "100% ↗" (green, upward arrow) instead of "0% —"
2. **Passports Created KPI**: "100% ↗" (green, upward arrow) instead of "0% —"  
3. **Passports Unpaid KPI**: "100% ↗" (red/orange, upward arrow) instead of "0% —"
4. **Active Users KPI**: "-- —" (unchanged, as designed - no historical comparison)

## Testing Recommendations

1. **API Testing**: `GET /api/kpi-data?period=7d` should return change values of 100.0
2. **Dashboard Testing**: KPI cards should show percentage changes with trend arrows
3. **Period Testing**: Test 7d, 30d, 90d, and all periods
4. **Activity-Specific Testing**: Test with `?activity_id=1` parameter
