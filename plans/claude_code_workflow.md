# Minipass - Claude Code Workflow Guide

## Overview

This workflow prevents Claude Code from over-engineering, creating bugs, or hallucinating enterprise-grade solutions for simple problems. Follow this process for every development session.

---

## 3-Layer Documentation Strategy

Your project uses **3 levels of guidance** for Claude Code:

1. **üìã PRD** (Strategic Context) - What to build and why
2. **‚öôÔ∏è Development Guidelines** (Technical Constraints) - How to build it
3. **üéØ Session Prompt** (Focus Reminder) - Stay on track each session

---

## Initial Project Setup (Do This Once)

### Step 1: Organize Project Documents
Place these documents in your Minipass project root folder:
- `Minipass PRD v1.0.md` 
- `Claude Code Development Guidelines.md`
- `Claude Code Workflow Guide.md` (this document)

### Step 2: Initialize Claude Code
```bash
cd /path/to/minipass-project
claude-code init
```
Claude Code will automatically read and understand your project context from the documents.

## Daily Development Workflow

### Before Each Coding Session

**1. Start Claude Code:**
```bash
claude-code chat
```

**2. Paste Session Prompt Template:**
```
CRITICAL CONSTRAINTS: Python Flask app, minimize JavaScript, SQLite per container, server-side rendering, low-RAM optimization. Fix ONE thing at a time, don't refactor working code. When unsure: choose Python over JavaScript.
```

### Making Development Requests

**3. Be Specific and Focused:**
‚úÖ **Good Example:**
```
Fix the payment validation error in routes.py line 45. Only change the validation logic, don't refactor the entire payment system. Check Development Guidelines section for JavaScript constraints.
```

‚ùå **Bad Example:**
```
Improve the payment system and make it better.
```

**4. Reference Documentation When Needed:**
- "Check PRD section 4.1 for the automatic payment matching requirements"
- "Follow Development Guidelines for JavaScript constraints" 
- "See PRD user stories for the expected behavior"

### During Development

**5. Enforce Constraints:**
If Claude Code suggests JavaScript solutions:
```
No, use the Python/Flask approach instead. Check the Development Guidelines - we minimize JavaScript to absolute bare minimum.
```

**6. Prevent Scope Creep:**
If Claude Code starts refactoring working code:
```
Stop. Fix only the specific bug I mentioned. Don't change working functionality.
```

**7. Validate Solutions:**
Ask Claude Code to explain:
```
Explain why this solution follows our memory constraints and Python-first approach.
```

## Session Templates for Common Tasks

### Bug Fix Session
```
CRITICAL CONSTRAINTS: Python Flask app, minimal JavaScript, fix ONE thing only.

I need to fix [specific bug description]. 
 
Only change what's necessary to fix this issue. Don't refactor working code around it. 

Always use the best competent agent for the task. Do not start a flask server. We already have one up and running for debug on port 8890.

Always test your task using playwrights mcp server and username = kdresdell@gmail.com and password = admin123

Reference: @Developmet_Guidelines.md [Bug Fix Protocol]
```

### New Feature Session  
```
CRITICAL CONSTRAINTS: Python Flask app, minimal JavaScript, server-side rendering.

I need to implement [specific feature from PRD]. This should follow our Python-first approach and integrate with existing Flask patterns.

Reference: PRD section [relevant section] and Development Guidelines
```

### Performance Optimization Session
```
CRITICAL CONSTRAINTS: < 512MB RAM per container, SQLite database, minimize resource usage.

I need to optimize [specific component] for memory usage. Focus on efficiency, don't add new features.

Reference: Development Guidelines performance section
```

## Quality Control Checklist

After each development session, verify:

### ‚úÖ **Technical Constraints Met**
- [ ] Uses Python/Flask patterns (not JavaScript)
- [ ] Server-side rendering with Jinja2
- [ ] Minimal memory usage approach
- [ ] SQLite database operations
- [ ] No unnecessary refactoring of working code

### ‚úÖ **Feature Requirements Met**
- [ ] Matches PRD specifications
- [ ] Maintains kid-friendly UI simplicity
- [ ] Follows activity-based business logic
- [ ] Preserves existing functionality

### ‚úÖ **Performance Standards**
- [ ] Fast response times
- [ ] Memory efficient
- [ ] Works in low-resource container

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

### Problem: Claude Code generates complex JavaScript
**Solution:** 
```
Stop. Check Development Guidelines - we use Python/Flask for this. Show me the server-side solution instead.
```

### Problem: Claude Code refactors working code
**Solution:**
```
Only fix the specific issue I mentioned. Don't change working functionality. Follow the "one bug = one change" rule.
```

### Problem: Claude Code suggests enterprise-grade solutions  
**Solution:**
```
This is too complex for our constraints. We need a simple Flask solution that uses minimal resources. Check our PRD - we target non-technical users.
```

### Problem: Code suggestions don't match business logic
**Solution:**
```
Check the PRD user stories and business rules. The solution should match our activity-based model with automatic payment matching.
```

## Success Indicators

**Your workflow is working when:**
‚úÖ Claude Code suggests simple Python solutions first  
‚úÖ Bug fixes don't create new bugs  
‚úÖ New features integrate cleanly with existing code  
‚úÖ Memory usage stays low  
‚úÖ Development stays focused on specific tasks  
‚úÖ Solutions match PRD business requirements  

---

## Emergency Reset Protocol

**If Claude Code starts hallucinating or over-engineering:**

1. **Stop the session immediately**
2. **Start fresh session** with prompt template
3. **Reference specific guideline sections**
4. **Be extremely specific** about requirements
5. **Ask for explanation** of how solution meets constraints

---

## Tips for Success

### üéØ **Stay Focused**
- One feature/bug at a time
- Resist urge to "improve while we're here"
- Complete current task before starting new ones

### üìñ **Reference Documentation**
- Point Claude Code to specific PRD/Guidelines sections
- Use documentation to resolve disagreements
- Keep business context in mind

### üêç **Python First**
- Always ask for Python solution first
- Question any JavaScript suggestions
- Prefer server-side over client-side logic

### ‚ö° **Keep It Simple**
- Simplest solution that meets requirements
- Optimize for maintainability
- Remember: non-technical users need to understand the results

## Remember

**Your PRD and Guidelines are your shield against AI over-engineering.** Use them to keep Claude Code focused on building the simple, efficient, bug-free application your customers need for September launch.

**Goal:** Deliver a lightweight, reliable, profitable SaaS application - not an enterprise monolith.
