# Safe Production Testing Plan - Email Payment Bot Testing

**Date:** November 1, 2025
**Purpose:** Test production database upgrade locally without conflicts with live production email monitoring

---

## üéØ The Problem

**Production and local dev CANNOT run simultaneously** because:
- Both would monitor the same email inbox for incoming payments
- Both would try to process the same e-transfers
- Both would move emails to processed folders
- **RESULT:** Complete chaos, duplicate processing, data corruption

---

## ‚úÖ The Solution: Sequential Testing

Test locally with production database while production is safely stopped, then deploy to production.

---

## üìã Step-by-Step Testing Plan

### Step 0: Prerequisites (Already Done! ‚úÖ)
- ‚úÖ Downloaded production backup from LHGI
- ‚úÖ Restored production database to local dev
- ‚úÖ Ran upgrade script: `python migrations/upgrade_production_database.py`
- ‚úÖ Marked migrations complete: `flask db stamp head`
- ‚úÖ Verified French survey template exists (8 questions)

---

### Step 1: Wait for Safe Shutdown Window ‚è∞

**TIMING IS CRITICAL:**
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Wait until AFTER tomorrow's hockey game**
- Choose a low-activity time window (late evening or early morning)
- Notify LHGI customer about brief maintenance window
- Estimated downtime: 2-4 hours for testing

**Communication to Customer:**
```
Hi [Customer],

We're upgrading your Minipass system with new features tonight.
The system will be offline from [TIME] to [TIME] (approximately 2-4 hours).

New features include:
- French survey templates
- Enhanced location tracking
- Performance improvements

We'll notify you when the upgrade is complete.

Thanks for your patience!
```

### Step 2: Stop Production Container üõë

**SSH into production VPS:**
```bash
# Connect to VPS
ssh user@production-vps

# Check running containers
docker ps

# Stop LHGI container
docker stop lhgi_container
# (Replace 'lhgi_container' with actual container name)

# Verify it's stopped
docker ps  # Should NOT show lhgi_container
```

**Important:** Production email payment bot is now inactive - inbox monitoring stopped.

---

### Step 3: Configure Local Email Payment Bot üìß

**On your local dev machine:**

```bash
cd ~/Documents/DEV/minipass_env/app
source venv/bin/activate

# Make sure Flask server is running on localhost:5000
flask run
```

**Configure Email Settings:**
1. Open browser: `http://localhost:5000`
2. Login as admin
3. Go to **Settings** ‚Üí **Email Configuration**
4. Configure production email credentials:
   - Email address: [production email]
   - Password: [production password]
   - IMAP server: [server address]
   - IMAP port: [usually 993]
5. Enable email payment bot
6. Set monitoring interval (e.g., every 30 minutes)

**Verify Email Bot is Working:**
- Check that bot can connect to email
- Check that bot can read inbox
- Check logs for any connection errors

---

### Step 4: Test Payment Matching üí∞

**Test Scenario 1: New Payment (If Possible)**
1. Have someone send a test e-transfer to production email
2. Wait for bot to process (check logs)
3. Verify payment is automatically matched
4. Verify passport is issued
5. Verify email confirmation sent

**Test Scenario 2: Review Existing Payments**
1. Go to **Payments** dashboard
2. Check that all historical payments from production are visible
3. Verify payment statuses are correct
4. Check that payment matching logs are intact

---

### Step 5: Full Feature Testing ‚úÖ

**Critical Tests (MUST PASS):**

#### A. Passport Scanning üèí

### Step 6: Monitor Email Bot Performance üìà

**While testing, monitor:**
- Email connection stability
- Payment matching accuracy
- Email processing speed
- Any error messages in logs

**Check Logs:**
```bash
# View Flask logs for email bot activity
# Look for patterns like:
# - "Email payment bot is ENABLED"
# - "Checking for new payments..."
# - "Found payment: $XX from user@email.com"
# - "Matched payment to signup ID: XX"
```

---

### Step 7: Decision Point - Ready for Production? üöÄ

**If ALL tests pass:**
- ‚úÖ Payment matching works
- ‚úÖ Passport scanning works
- ‚úÖ All images display
- ‚úÖ French survey exists
- ‚úÖ No data corruption
- ‚úÖ Email bot is stable

**‚Üí PROCEED TO PRODUCTION DEPLOYMENT**

**If ANY test fails:**
- ‚ùå Fix issues locally first
- ‚ùå DO NOT deploy to production
- ‚ùå Restore production from backup if needed
- ‚ùå Contact user for guidance

---

### Step 8: Deploy to Production üéâ

**When confident everything works:**

```bash
# SSH into production VPS
ssh user@production-vps
cd /path/to/lhgi_app

# Create backup FIRST (critical!)
docker exec lhgi_container cp instance/minipass.db instance/minipass.db.backup_before_upgrade_$(date +%Y%m%d_%H%M%S)

# Pull latest code
docker exec lhgi_container git pull origin main

# Run upgrade commands
docker exec lhgi_container bash -c "source venv/bin/activate && python migrations/upgrade_production_database.py"
docker exec lhgi_container bash -c "source venv/bin/activate && flask db stamp head"

# Restart container
docker restart lhgi_container

# Verify container started
docker ps  # Should show lhgi_container running

# Check logs for errors
docker logs lhgi_container --tail 50
```

**Immediately After Deployment:**
1. Test app loads: `https://lhgi.yourdomain.com`
2. Test passport scanning
3. Check dashboard loads
4. Verify email bot resumes monitoring
5. Monitor logs for 30 minutes

---

### Step 9: Notify Customer ‚úÖ

**Success Message:**
```
Hi [Customer],

Your Minipass upgrade is complete!

New features now available:
‚úÖ French survey templates (8 questions)
‚úÖ Enhanced location tracking for activities

```

---

## üîÑ Rollback Plan (If Something Goes Wrong)

**If production deployment fails:**

```bash
# SSH into production VPS
ssh user@production-vps

# Stop container
docker stop lhgi_container

# Restore database from backup
docker exec lhgi_container cp instance/minipass.db.backup_before_upgrade_YYYYMMDD instance/minipass.db

# Revert code (if needed)
docker exec lhgi_container git reset --hard HEAD~1

# Restart container
docker restart lhgi_container

# Verify old version is running
docker logs lhgi_container --tail 50
```
