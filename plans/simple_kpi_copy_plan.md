# SIMPLE FUCKING COPY PLAN - KPI CARDS

## Current Situation
- **dashboard.html** is WORKING PERFECTLY with KPIs
- **get_kpi_data()** function is WORKING PERFECTLY  
- We have 3 working elements on dashboard.html:
  1. Python: `get_kpi_data()` function providing data (EXACTLY as dashboard uses it)
  2. HTML: The 4 KPI card components 
  3. JavaScript: Initialization script for the KPI cards

## THE PLAN - 3 SIMPLE STEPS

### STEP 1: DELETE ALL KPI SHIT FROM activity_dashboard.html
- Find and DELETE all existing KPI card HTML in activity_dashboard.html
- Remove ALL the broken KPI cards completely - they're GONE
- Clean slate - no KPI cards left

### STEP 2: COPY THE 3 WORKING ELEMENTS (EXACT COPY)
1. **Python side**: Use EXACTLY what dashboard.html uses - same get_kpi_data() call, same data structure
2. **HTML side**: Copy the EXACT 4 KPI card HTML from dashboard.html to activity_dashboard.html
3. **JavaScript side**: Copy the EXACT JavaScript initialization from dashboard.html to activity_dashboard.html

### STEP 3: VERIFY IT'S IDENTICAL
- Dashboard has 4 KPI cards → Activity Dashboard has 4 KPI cards
- Dashboard shows global data → Activity Dashboard shows THE SAME global data
- Everything is IDENTICAL - no filtering, no changes, just a pure copy

## RESULT
- If I go to dashboard.html → I see 4 KPI cards
- If I go to activity_dashboard.html → I see THE EXACT SAME 4 KPI cards
- Same numbers, same charts, same everything

## THAT'S IT - NO CHANGES, JUST COPY
- Don't modify the KPI cards
- Don't change the JavaScript
- Don't fuck with the data structure
- Don't add activity filtering
- Just DELETE the broken shit and COPY the working shit

This is a 2-minute copy operation. Nothing more.
