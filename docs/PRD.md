## 2. Product Overview

### 2.1 Problem Statement
**Primary Market - Activity Managers:** Small business owners and activity managers who organize recurring activities (sports leagues, fitness classes, workshops, tournaments) currently struggle with fragmented manual processes. They use Excel spreadsheets for registrations, handle bank transfers manually, track payments in multiple systems, and manage attendance through paper lists or basic apps.

**Secondary Market - Small Business Loyalty Programs:** Small service businesses (coffee shops, salons, local services) rely on outdated paper punch cards for customer loyalty programs. These businesses miss opportunities for upfront revenue, struggle to track loyalty redemptions, and provide poor customer experience with easily-lost paper cards.

### 2.2 Solution
Minipass provides a unified digital platform serving both markets:

**For Activity Managers:**
- Create activities (e.g., "Monday Night Hockey", "September Golf Tournament") 
- Define passport types within each activity (e.g., "Substitute Pass", "Season Pass")
- Generate automatic web-based registration forms
- Process payments and automatically issue digital passports
- Track attendance through QR code scanning or manual redemption

**For Small Business Loyalty Programs:**
- Create loyalty activities (e.g., "Coffee Shop Loyalty Program")
- Define passport types for bulk purchases (e.g., "10 Coffees for $50", "5 Haircuts for $200")
- Generate upfront revenue through pre-paid service packages
- Track redemptions digitally, eliminating paper punch cards
- Build customer retention through convenient mobile access

### 2.3 Value Proposition
**For Activity Managers:**
- Eliminate Excel chaos and manual payment reconciliation
- Automatic email payment matching saves hours of administrative work
- Professional automated participant communication builds trust and reduces support requests
- Clear financial visibility with real-time KPI dashboards
- Never manually send payment confirmations or activity updates

**For Small Businesses (Loyalty):**
- Generate upfront cash flow through pre-paid packages
- Eliminate paper cards and manual tracking
- Automatic payment processing for email transfers
- Professional customer communication improves brand perception
- Reduce customer service inquiries with clear transaction history

**For All Participants/Customers:**

### 12.1 **Code Architecture Rules** üìã
**Python-First Development:**
- All business logic, data validation, and processing in Python
- Use Flask's templating system for dynamic HTML generation
- Database operations exclusively in Python (SQLAlchemy/raw SQL)
- Form handling and validation in Python using Flask-WTF

**Minimal JavaScript Policy:**
- JavaScript ONLY for: form enhancements, basic UI interactions, QR code scanning
- Maximum 10 lines per JavaScript function when possible
- Use vanilla JavaScript, avoid jQuery or heavy libraries
- Server-side rendering preferred over client-side dynamic content

**Performance-First Decisions:**
- Choose simple over complex solutions every time
- Optimize for memory usage and startup speed
- Use SQLite for single-tenant containers
- Avoid unnecessary HTTP requests and API calls

### 12.2 **Technology Stack Justification**
- **Flask:** Lightweight, minimal overhead, fast startup
- **Tabler.io:** CSS-only framework, no JavaScript dependencies
- **SQLite:** No separate database server, embedded, fast for single-tenant
- **Jinja2:** Server-side templating reduces client-side complexity
- **Python stdlib:** Use built-in libraries when possible

### 12.3 **CRITICAL: AI Coding Assistant Guidelines** ‚ö†Ô∏è

**FOR ANY AI CODING ASSISTANT (INCLUDING CLAUDE CODE):**

**Mandatory JavaScript Constraints:**
- **DEFAULT RULE:** Always try Python/Flask solution first before considering JavaScript
- **JavaScript ONLY for:** Basic form validation, QR code scanning, simple UI interactions
- **Maximum JavaScript Function Size:** 10 lines preferred, 25 lines absolute maximum
- **No JavaScript Frameworks:** No jQuery, React, Vue, Angular - vanilla JavaScript only when required
- **No Complex JavaScript Logic:** No business logic, data processing, or API calls in JavaScript
- **One Bug Fix = One Change:** Never refactor surrounding code when fixing a bug

**Preferred Solutions Examples:**
- **Form Handling:** Use Flask-WTF and server-side validation, NOT client-side JavaScript validation
- **Dynamic Content:** Use Jinja2 templating with server-side data, NOT JavaScript DOM manipulation  
- **Data Display:** Server-side HTML generation, NOT JavaScript table libraries
- **User Feedback:** Flash messages with Flask, NOT JavaScript modals or notifications
- **Payment Processing:** Server-side with Stripe, NOT JavaScript payment widgets

**Forbidden Approaches:**
- ‚ùå Enterprise-grade JavaScript solutions for simple problems
- ‚ùå JavaScript libraries for tasks Python can handle
- ‚ùå Client-side data processing when server-side is possible
- ‚ùå Complex JavaScript state management
- ‚ùå JavaScript-based routing or navigation
- ‚ùå Refactoring working code when fixing unrelated bugs

**Bug Fix Protocol:**
1. **Minimal Change Principle:** Fix only the specific issue, don't improve surrounding code
2. **Python-First:** If bug is in JavaScript, consider if it can be moved to Python instead
3. **Test Isolation:** Ensure fix doesn't affect other working features
4. **Documentation:** Explain why each change is necessary

### 12.4 **Resource Optimization Strategy**
- **Memory:** Lazy loading, efficient data structures, connection pooling
- **CPU:** Minimize complex computations, cache frequently accessed data  
- **Disk:** Compress static files, optimize database schemas
- **Network:** Minimize external API calls, batch operations

## 13. Questions for Discussion

1. Should we prioritize mobile-first development or responsive web design for the scanning interface?
2. What's our approach for handling different time zones for activities that might span regions?
3. How do we handle seasonal activities that go dormant - do they still count against activity limits during off-season?
4. Should the UI differentiate between "activity management" and "loyalty program" modes, or keep one unified interface?
5. What level of passport customization should we offer in MVP (logos, colors, fields)?
6. How should we handle partial redemptions (e.g., someone has a 10-session pass, uses 3 sessions)?
7. Should the activity manager be able to issue refunds directly, or should that require admin approval?
8. For loyalty programs, should we support percentage discounts or only pre-paid packages?
9. How do we market to both activity managers AND small business owners - one website or separate positioning?
10. Should small businesses be able to set expiration dates on loyalty packages?

### Market Expansion Considerations
- **Dual Market Strategy:** The same platform serves activity managers and loyalty programs with identical technical requirements
- **Cross-Selling Opportunity:** A yoga instructor could use it for both class management AND loyalty packages
- **Marketing Challenge:** Need to communicate value to two different buyer personas with different pain points
- **UI Design:** Interface should be intuitive for both use cases without feeling cluttered

## 14. Operations & Support Strategy

### 14.1 **Customer Onboarding Process**
**Automated Container Deployment:**
1. Customer subscribes via main Flask website landing page
2. Collects: Organization name, desired subdomain, primary email (3-4 questions total)
3. Automated validation: Check subdomain availability, email format
4. Automated container deployment triggered upon successful validation
5. Beautiful welcome email sent with: subdomain URL, initial credentials, "getting started" video link
6. Video Onboarding: 2-3 minute maximum video showing basic system operation

**Design Principle:** Onboarding should be so intuitive that customers don't need the video, but it's there as a safety net.

### 14.2 **Customer Support Strategy**
**Support Philosophy:** Prevent issues rather than fix them - focus on bug-free, high-performance system.

**Support Channels:**
- **Primary:** Chat-based support (Microsoft Teams, Discord, or similar messaging platform)
- **Secondary:** Video/voice support available for complex issues
- **Self-Service:** Comprehensive library of short, engaging tutorial videos
- **Documentation:** Simple, visual guides for all core features

**Support Materials:**
- Multiple tutorial videos showing real-world usage scenarios
- Step-by-step visual guides for common tasks
- FAQ section based on actual customer questions

### 14.3 **Performance Monitoring & Infrastructure**
**Current Monitoring:** Custom Python scripts monitoring VPS performance and container health

**Scaling Triggers:** Evaluate CPU, RAM, and disk upgrades after every 10 new customers

**Health Monitoring Needs:**
- Container startup/crash detection
- Memory usage per customer container
- Database performance metrics
- Email delivery success rates
- Payment processing success rates

### 14.4 **Error Handling & Logging**
**User-Facing Errors:**
- Friendly error messages in the dashboard with clear next steps
- Color-coded status indicators for payment issues, email problems
- Complete audit trail of all transactions and system events

**Technical Logging:**
- All errors logged in user's dashboard for transparency
- Payment failures: Clear status with actionable information
- Email issues: Automatic bounce-back notifications to user's email
- System errors: Logged but presented in user-friendly language

**Error Recovery:**
- Automatic retry mechanisms for temporary failures
- Clear escalation path for issues requiring manual intervention
- User notification for any issue that affects their service
